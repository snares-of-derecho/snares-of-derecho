## Sandro (or Alessandro) [3rd Syshost]
Hey, I'm a Sanemi fictive and I'm generally hosting when other Kimetsu no Yaiba headmates are active.

The DNI on our main Github applies here too, so just check it. I'm not posting it twice. We'll block freely anyways if we actually have an issue.

I'm fixated on severe weather, mostly tornadoes, but any wind related phenomenon will do. The Jarell tornado of 1997 has to be a favorite of mine.

I'm not as abrasive as my source, don't act like I'm going to bite your head off if you know I'm fronting please.
