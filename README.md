## Sandro (or Alessandro) [3rd Syshost]
Hey, I'm a Sanemi fictive and I'm generally hosting when other Kimetsu no Yaiba headmates are active.

The DNI on our main Github applies here too, so just check it. I'm not posting it twice. We'll block freely anyways if we actually have an issue.

I'm fixated on severe weather, mostly tornadoes, but any wind related phenomenon will do. The Jarell tornado of 1997 has to be a favorite of mine. I also like Splatoon, JSR/JSRF, Pok√©mon and Naruto.

If you couldn't tell, my username is a small reference to a KITCALIBER song; [Snares of Jericho](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=2wcd1BqdTCI&si=6AHqE2g3LF6miTYC), and a [Derecho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derecho) is a form of severe weather.

C+H is allowed, but I'm often offtab or sitting with friends who may not want to sit with you.

*(Note; if you like any of these stamps on my repository, I made them and you're free to take them. I'll have a rentry with all of the stamps I've been making pretty soon. Feel free to credit by linking my Github but it's really not necessary whatsoever.)*
